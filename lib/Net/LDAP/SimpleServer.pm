=head1 NAME

Net::LDAP::SimpleServer - Minimal-configuration, read-only LDAP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<< WORK IN PROGRESS!! NOT READY TO USE YET!! >>

    package MyServer;

    use Net::LDAP::SimpleServer;

    # Or, specifying a Net::Server personality
    use Net::LDAP::SimpleServer 'PreFork';

    # using default configuration file
    my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new();

    # passing a specific configuration file
    my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new({
        conf_file => '/etc/ldapconfig.conf'
    });

    # passing configurations in a hash
    my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new({
        port => 5000,
        data => '/path/to/data.ldif',
    });

    # make it spin
    $server->run();

The default configuration file is:

    ${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for author to fill in:
    Write a full description of the module and its features here.
    Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.

As the name suggests, this module aims to implement a simple LDAP server, 
using many components already available in CPAN. It can be used for
prototyping and/or development purposes. This is B<NOT> intended to be a
production-grade server, altough some brave souls in small offices might
use it as such.

As of November 2010, the server will simply load a LDIF file and serve its
contents through the LDAP protocol. Many operations are B<NOT> available yet,
notably writing into the directory tree, but we would like to implement that
in a near future.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR 

The constructors will follow the rules defined by L<Net::Server>, but most
notably we have the two forms below:

=over

=item new()

Attempts to create a server by using the default configuration file,
C<< ${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config >>.

=item new( HASHREF )

Attempts to create a server by using the options specified in a hash
reference rather than reading them from a configuration file.

=back

=head1 METHODS 

=over

=item options()

As specified in L<Net::Server>, this method creates new options for the,
server, namely:

=over

data - the LDIF data file used by LDIFStore

root_dn - the administrator DN of the repository

root_pw - the password for root_dn

=back

=item default_values()

As specified in L<Net::Server>, this method provides default values for a
number of options. In Net::LDAP::SimpleServer, this method is defined as:

    sub default_values {
        return {
            host         => '*',
            port         => 389,
            proto        => 'tcp',
            root_id      => 'cn=root',
            root_pw      => 'ldappw',
            syslog_ident => 'Net::LDAP::SimpleServer-'
                . $Net::LDAP::SimpleServer::VERSION,
            conf_file => DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE,
        };
    }

Notice that we do set a default password for the C<< cn=root >> DN. This
allows for out-of-the-box testing, but make sure you change the password
when putting this to production use.

=item post_configure_hook()

Method specified by L<Net::Server> to validate the passed options

=item process_request()

Method specified by L<Net::Server> to actually handle one connection. In this
module it basically delegates the processing to
L<Net::LDAP::SimpleServer::ProtocolHandler>.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< Error message here, perhaps with %s placeholders >>

[Description of error here]

=item C<< Another error message here >>

[Description of error here]

[Et cetera, et cetera]

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
    A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
    module, including the names and locations of any configuration
    files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
    that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
    configuration language used.
  
Net::LDAP::SimpleServer may use a configuration file to specify the
server settings. If no file is specified and options are not passed
in a hash, this module will look for a default configuration file named
C<< ${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config >>. 

    data /path/to/a/ldif/file.ldif
    #port 389
    #root_id cn=root
    #root_pw somepassword
    #objectclass_req (true|false)
    #user_tree dc=some,dc=subtree,dc=com
    #user_id_attr uid
    #user_pw_attr password


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.
